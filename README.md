## IMD MONITORING ##
IMD BENDOR ERRORS BEING MONITORED
0 Hz
High → Short-circuit to Ub + (Kl. 15)
Low → IMD off or short-circuit to Kl. 31

10 Hz – Normal Condition
Insulation measurement (DCP)
Starts 2 seconds after power-on
First successful insulation measurement ≤ 17.5 s
PWM active 5–95%

20 Hz – Undervoltage Condition
Insulation measurement DCP (continuous)
Starts 2 seconds after power-on
PWM active 5–95%
First successful insulation measurement ≤ 17.5 s
Undervoltage detection range: 0–500 V (Bender configurable)

30 Hz – Speed Start Measurement
Insulation measurement (good/bad evaluation only)
Starts immediately after power-on (≤ 2 s)
PWM: 5–10% (good), 90–95% (bad)

40 Hz – Device Error
Device error detected
PWM 47.5–52.5%

50 Hz – Connection Fault to Earth
Fault detected on earth connection (Kl. 31)
PWM 47.5–52.5%
